fopen的各个模式对应的open的flag应该怎么样表示？

> `r` : `O_RDONLY`
>
> `w` : `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`
>
> `a` : `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND`
>
> `r+` : `O_RDWR`
>
> `w+` : `O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`
>
> `a+` : `O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_APPEND`

将下面的内容保存到一个文件当中：

High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.

He was very much admired indeed. "He is as beautiful as a weathercock," remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; "only not quite so useful," he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.

 

随后，编写一个C程序，将所有的小写字母转换成大写字符，标点符号转换成空格。需要使用mmap。

```c
#include <func.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    ARGS_CHECK(argc, 2);

    int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR);
    ERROR_CHECK(fd, -1, "open");

    off_t file_size = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);
    ERROR_CHECK(file_size, -1, "lseek");

    int ret = ftruncate(fd, file_size);
    ERROR_CHECK(ret, -1, "ftruncate");

    char* p = (char*) mmap(NULL, file_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    ERROR_CHECK(p, MAP_FAILED, "mmap");

    for (int i=0; i < file_size; ++i) {
        if (islower(p[i]))
            p[i] = toupper(p[i]);
        else if (ispunct(p[i]))
            p[i] = ' ';
    }

    munmap(p, file_size);
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}

```
